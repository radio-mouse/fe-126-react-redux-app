      Redesigning Human Uniform - or RHU for short - was co-created by Zara and
      Rhuigi Villaseñor in 2022. By combining Villaseñor’s aesthetic with Zara’s
      global network and, their shared intention was to create a wardrobe
      infused with the qualities and codes of modern progressive luxury at a
      scale and price point that made it accessible to all. Following a first
      collection, Zara and Villaseñor have reunited to present a newly evolved
      and expanded edition of RHU’s contemporary “uniform”.

    <p>
      &nbsp;Speaking on set during Willy Vanderperre’s new RHU campaign shoot,
      Villaseñor said: “The premise and the goal of this project remains the
      same: to enable young people with a real-world budget to access my
      aesthetic codes and design. RHU is an exercise in fashion democracy in
      which every piece is conceived, prototyped and produced with the values of
      dignity and accessibility front and center.”&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      This second RHU edition is informally entitled Cross Country - a script
      also emblazoned on one of its Villaseñor-signature varsity jackets - to
      reflect the all-terrain philosophy that is specific to this project. That
      is, as last season, to be unbound by&nbsp;traditional codes in
      contemporary clothing in order to enable total freedom of expression
      through style. This bold creative endeavour also empowers the wearer to
      transcend conventional notions of ‘sportswear’, ‘luxury’ and ‘streetwear’.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;That varsity jacket, black on black, is the starting point of a
      collection that surveys the landscape of contemporary fashion to combine
      its greatest landmarks with a fresh perspective. “Plus, with Zara as my
      partner, I want to go across the world with this,” adds Villaseñor. Denim,
      workwear, moto, baselayers, Ivy League, tailoring, climbing gear,
      sneakers, and formal footwear are all amongst the classifications and
      categories drawn from. “What I see is that kids today don’t want to
      conform or be defined by the codes and boundaries that apply to their
      parents&apos; thinking. That philosophy is reflected in the way they wish
      to appear. Bagginess is comfortable and freeing, but they move between
      oversized and cropped or maybe tighter on the body to play with mixed
      proportions. And we keep looking to the future with the mix of prints and
      play of color. My only regret about this collection is that it was not
      available for me back when I was shaping my own identity and style through
      clothing.”

      &nbsp;The collection spans<strong>&nbsp;</strong>over 20 RHU ready to wear
      pieces, five&nbsp;RHU shoe styles, and six RHU bags: an open-source
      toolkit for modern eclectic dressing.{" "}
