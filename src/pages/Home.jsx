          Redesigning Human Uniform - or RHU for short - was co-created by Zara
          and Rhuigi Villaseñor in 2022. By combining Villaseñor’s aesthetic
          with Zara’s global network and, their shared intention was to create a
          wardrobe infused with the qualities and codes of modern progressive
          luxury at a scale and price point that made it accessible to all.
          Following a first collection, Zara and Villaseñor have reunited to
          present a newly evolved and expanded edition of RHU’s contemporary
          “uniform”.
